I have used ASP.NET - C# to build the app in approximately 2 hours using the given database. However since I used the SSMS to build the database, you might not see the actual values unless you run a migration in you device. Here I have pasted the 2 screenshots of the working application with all the parameters as per instructions. I have used the MVC architecture and will be using the layered architecture if the time permitted to increase the layers and improve code reusability and testability. Also I have reduced the scale of the database tables to top 1000 for easier processing and faster results.
